                <p>My name is Daniel Scott, I'm 22 years old, originally from Alton, Hampshire but currently studying Computer Science, at Plymouth university and I'm currently in my second year of study.
                    I am a Software Engineer with a passion for learning and building with cutting edge technology, to hopefully one day help shape the future of technology. 
                </p>
                <p>I have extensive knowledge within the Computer Science field, speciailising in C# and Java mainly as those are the languages I have used the most. 
                    One of my main areas of study is TCP/IP network communication as it's really how I got into programming from the early age of 13, although as a Computer Scientist, I'm always 
                    playing around with concepts and ideas. Whether that's on the web in the form of a HTML/CSS/Javascript website or some really dirty low level C/Assembly code.
